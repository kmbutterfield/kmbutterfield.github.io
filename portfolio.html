				<h1>GEOG5990M: Programming for Spatial Analysts: Assessment 1</h1>
				<p>Here you will find the link to my project work for an agent-based model that was built following practical sessions for the assignment named above. The module is part of my MA Social Research (Interdisciplinary) programme, which has taught me the Python language, allowing me to utilise this skill during my PhD at the University of Leeds.
				<br><br>You can access the final code and further information about the project by clicking <strong><a href="https://github.com/kmbutterfield/Programming-for-Spatial-Analysts-Assessment-1">this link</strong></a> which will take you to my GitHub repository.</p>

				<h1>GEOG5990M: Programming for Spatial Analysts: Assessment 2</h1>
				<p>This is the second assessed project for my coding module using Python. This agent-based model has been coded without assistance or practicals to demonstrate how well I can code. The project's environment is a city, which simulates drunk people attempting to travel home after a night out.
				<br><br>You can access the final code and further information about the project by clicking <strong><a href="https://github.com/kmbutterfield/Programming-for-Spatial-Analysts-Assessment-2">this link</strong></a> which will take you to my GitHub repository.</p>
