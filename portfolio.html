				<h1>GEOG5990M: Programming for Spatial Analysts: Assessment 1</h1>

				<p>Here you will find the link to my project work for an agent-based model that was built following practical sessions for the assignment named above. The module is part of my MA Social Research (Interdisciplinary) programme, which has taught me the Python language, allowing me to utilise this skill during my PhD at the University of Leeds.
				<br><br>Key Model Notes
				<ul><li> The environment can be altered by the agents as they eat their way around.
				<br><li> The agents know that they are not alone in the model and can interact such as being able to share 'data' stores.
				<br><li> If an agent is in the way of another, it will move around the environment, and not on top of the other agent.
				<br><li> Each agent has a data store capacity of 1000, if it consumes any more data it will vomit, depositing all of its data stores.
				<br><li> The behaviours of each agent in their environment can be viewed as an animation. If a piece of data has been consumed by an agent, the environment patch will change colour and will have a decreased data store.
				<br></ul>You can access the final code and further information about the project by clicking <strong><a href="https://github.com/kmbutterfield/Programming-for-Spatial-Analysts-Assessment-1">this link</strong></a> which will take you to my GitHub repository.<br></p>

				<h1>GEOG5990M: Programming for Spatial Analysts: Assessment 2</h1>

				<p>This is the second assessed project for my coding module using Python. This agent-based model has been coded without assistance or practicals to demonstrate how well I can code. The project's environment is a city, which simulates drunk people attempting to travel home after a night out.
				<br><br>You can access the final code and further information about the project by clicking <strong><a href="https://github.com/kmbutterfield/Programming-for-Spatial-Analysts-Assessment-2">this link</strong></a> which will take you to my GitHub repository.<br></p>
